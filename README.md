# Business Model Canvas template for Obsidian
Business Model Canvas template for Obsidian and Obsidian Kanban*

Lean canvas with its nine building blocks from [Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas), ready to use with Obsidian.

## Requirements

You'll need the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) app, with [Obsidian Kanban Plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/kanban/Obsidian+Kanban+Plugin) by [Matthew Meyers](https://github.com/mgmeyers) installed.

After downloading the *lean canvas* folder from GitHub, pick the "open folder as vault" option in Obsidian.

You can then start filling your business model canvas.
